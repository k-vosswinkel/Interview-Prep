# Prompts in the interview process

Technical things:

- algorithms, e.g. *impelement mergesort*
- concept questions, e.g. *what is closure*
- code analysis, e.g. *what does this code print*
- project code spelunking, e.g. *tell me about this function you wrote for <project/>*
- coding challenge, e.g. *build an app that allows users to create and share quizzes*
- logic / reasoning puzzles, e.g. *how many golf balls fit in a bus*
- architecture, e.g. *design battleship*

...there are non-technical things:

- culuture fit questions, e.g. *what drew you to us in particular*
- experiences questions, e.g. *tell me about a time when <challening-thing-relevant-to-this-job/>*
- scenarios, e.g. *your PM meets with your team of eight to lay out a new feature you'll buiding, and she tells you the deadline is in one month, but to you it sounds like it'll take a minimum of 2 months*

# Technical ones, good technique across the board

- have fun! bring curiosty, enthusiasm, and joy
- treat interview as collaborator, friend—remember they *want* to hire you
- be candid, don't b.s.
- focus on what you *do* know, not what you don't
- ask for silent thinking time if you need it
- engage your interviewer as much as possible (as little unplanned silence as possible)
- "breadth first" approach: break it up into sub problems and solve each of those—e.g. you implement mergesort by doing:

```js
function mergeSort (arr) {
  const halves = splitInHalf(arr);
  const sortedLeft = mergeSort(halves[0]);
  const sortedRight = mergeSort(halves[1]);
  return mergeInOrder(sortedLeft, sortedRight);
}
```

# Things will go wrong

- remember how many times something went wrong learning / building something at Fullstack, remember you evolved past it
- commiserate ~> re-hash ~> learn ~> adapt (what doesn't kill you makes you stronger)
- reach to others (including your peers and me)

# Algorithms

- often involve a whiteboard
- REACTO
- focus on talking through it

*Why do interviewers do this?*

- they're trying to see how you think
- how you approach problems
- what's in your neural database
- a sort-of simlulated pair-programming / teamwork environment
- what you're like without your fancy tools

# Concept questions

- domain knowledge (trivia)
- focus on what you *do* know
- use examples
- use metaphors

*Why do interviewers do this?*

- probe the depth of your understanding
- can indicate passion for the technology
- communication skills

# Code analysis

- debug, analyze, refactor some code they give you
- reasoning >> truth

*Why do interviewers do this?*

- your job will involve looking at code you didn't write
- probe the depth of your understanding
- what your reasoning looks like

# Project code spelunking

- questions about code you've written
- if they ask you about things you didn't do
- be honest
- if you can elaborate / explain what's happening, do
- offer another spot that you worked on

*Why do interviewers do this?*

- validate your contribution
- tangible sense of you as a programmer
- try to get a sense of project planning / management

# Coding challenge

- usually given mid-interview
- done by yourself asynchronously over the course of day(s)
- try to stand out
- don't solve all sorts of problems they don't ask for
- tests!
- insides >> outsides
- time management can be tough

*Why do interviewers do this?*

- free work
- work ethic / initiative / meeting deadlines
- a lot like spelunking, but more standardized

# Logic / reasoning puzzles

- solve this riddle
- sometimes there'll be a "right" answer, other times not
- if you get this, rejoice, because you can explore the problem

*Why do interviewers do this?*

- somebody can stand out without "domain" knowledge
- looking for how "bright" is this person
- how does this person think about problems
- probing for reasoning abilities
- maybe they're a bit too into themselves

# Architecture

- high-level planning, often involves *zero* coding
- may involve mentioning tools / libraries
- ask a lot of questions, interviewers will mean different things when they say something like "design battleship"
- think about ERDs
- think about UX flows
- think about needs and the tools that solve those needs

*Why do interviewers do this?*

- less "mechanical" more "abstract" top-level thinking
- how data flows in an application
- there's a difference between a "programmer" and an "software engineer"
