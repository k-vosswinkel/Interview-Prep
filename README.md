# FSA Technical Interview Prep

This repo contains the Fullstack senior phase technical interview prep materials, notably including the current canonical REACTO curriculum (see the `/algorithms` folder).

The technical interview prep curriculum is in this format so that we can use git for source control.

# How To

Instructions for how to share and conduct reacto problems are found in the file [How To REACTO](./how-to.md)

# Contributing
