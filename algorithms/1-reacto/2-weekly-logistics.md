REACTO occurs at the beginning of each day during senior phase.

Every week will begin with an instructor interactive lecture on a topic. The remaining part of the week will be dedicated to mock interviews (more on mock interview logistics in the next action) where the technical problems will revolve around those .

There are five topics:

* Big O
* Data Structures
* Optimizations
* Numbers
* Functional Programming
