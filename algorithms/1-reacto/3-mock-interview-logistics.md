You will be assigned a partner where one of you is the interviewer and one of you the candidate.

# Interviewers Prep

All interviewers should review the prompt the night before and come prepared with questions the next morning when the instructor or fellow will introduce it to them. You will need to know it well enough to deliver it yourself. Candidates should *not* look at the problemsâ€”ever.

# Mock Interview

After this introduction, each interviewer and their candidate pair up and run through a mock technical interview for the given prompt, playing their respective roles.

Note: candidates should ideally use only a whiteboard. If you do not have access to a whiteboard, you can use a text editor as long as you:

A) Do not use the internet, or notes, or anything on your computer to help you get an answer.
B) Disable syntax highlighting and linting.
C) Do not copy-paste.

...in order to more closely simulate some challenges of a whiteboarding environment. 

# Review

Afterwards, the instructor or fellow will review possible solutions, field questions, and summarize the key takeaways.

The next day, your role swaps. If you were an interviewer one day, you'll be a candidate the next, and vice versa.
