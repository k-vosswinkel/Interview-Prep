The PDFs here contain programming "concept and trivia" questions from a game show we used to do during senior phase. The game show rules are unimportant—the actual important things to note:

1. There will often be pre-readings towards the beginning of the PDFs. Read some / all before continuing further in the PDF.
2. Each question will be followed by its answer—so don't just flip through the slides quickly. Stop at each question, try to answer it, *then* look at the answer.
