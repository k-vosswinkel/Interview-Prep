# Going Through Our Stack
## Back-End
#### JavaScript
1. What is it?
  It's an multi-paradigm language that is used for:
  - Object oriented programming
  - Functional programming
  - Imperative programming
  - Declarative programming
3. What are some alternatives to this language?
  - Python
  - Ruby
  - Java
  - C++
  - Etc...
4. Why would I use this instead of another, similar language?
  - If you have a lot of simultaneous server requests to handle quickly, JS is a great option.
  - It's flexible and easy to develop with because you don't have to switch between languages as you move from front to back end.

#### Node.js
for reference: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/blocking-vs-non-blocking/
https://nodejs.org/en/about/
1. What is this library?
  - It is an asynchronous, event-driven, JavaScript runtime/server environment.
  - It is a cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
  - It is a single-threaded event loop registered with the system to handle connections.
2. What does this environment do (i.e. how does it interact with other parts of the app)?
  It allows us to use compile JavaScript to use it on the back end. ** ?? **
3. What are some alternatives to this environment?
  - Alternatives would require a different back-end language:
    1. Ruby on Rails (Ruby)
    2. Django (Python)
    3. .Net or Apache ** ?? **
4. Why would I use this instead of another, similar environment?
  - If you want to use JS, you need Node.
  - It requires less memory to handle more concurrent calls.
  - NPM is flexible and easy to use. Allows for scalable apps.
  - JS is still one of the most frequently-used languages, so it's easy to apply!

#### PostgreSQL (Postgres)
1. What is this library?
  - Relational Database written in SQL
2. What does this database do (i.e. how does it interact with other parts of the app)?
  - It stores the app's data in a series of tables
  - It uses relationships to map connections between tables
3. What are some alternatives to this database?
  - MySQL
  - SQLite
  - MongoDB (Cloud-based and NoSQL)
  - GraphQL (NoSQL)
4. Why would I use this instead of another, similar database?
  - If you want an easy-to-use, relational database, Postgres is a good option
  - Very popular and often-used. Developer community is active; lots of support
  - If you want to go cloud-based or
