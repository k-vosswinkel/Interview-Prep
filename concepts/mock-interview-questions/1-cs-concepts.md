#Programming Paradigms
##Object-Oriented Programming
*A programming solution that acts as a collection or network of collaborating objects. Through OOP, objects have their own private internal state & communications protocols.*
1. Explain the four main concept of OOP
  - Abstraction: the data that an object encapsulates is hidden from the external world. Users can't see internal state.
  - Encapsulation: objects in OOP encapsulate data and behaviour, where data is the object's internal state and behaviour is the set of functions or “methods” that operate on the data.
  - Inheritance: an object can inherit data and behaviour from another object (a “parent”), and add custom data and behaviour on top of the inheritance.
  - Polymorphism: (Declarative programming) - an object can adhere to many definitions; i.e. it can handle information in different
  ways, and it's not the users job to worry about how the object is handling the data. You pass in data, and the object handles it.

##Functional Programming
*Functional Programming is a paradigm that emphasizes declarative programming and pure functions*
2. Things that FP avoids:
  - Shared state
  - Mutating state
  - Functional side effects

3. Give an example where you would use OOP or FP and why you would choose to use that strategy
  - Benefits of OOP include:
    - sadfsd
    - adsf
  - OOP example: React class components
  - Benefits of FP include:
  - FP Example: Redux store;
